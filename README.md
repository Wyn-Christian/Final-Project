# Fast-food Restaurant Ordering System
## Objective
Our objective is to create a program whose purpose is to navigate through a fast-food
restaurants’ ordering system database, which contains the restaurants’ order list and currencies, 
and provide a receipt upon the user finishing their desired input for their orders. 
Agenda

The code for this program is consisted of arrays and functions. As the user navigates through the 
program, a menu screen will appear and ask them what type of food they want to order. After the 
user does their inputs, the program will then store the information to its database for future uses. 
This is made possible with the use of arrays and pointers in the source code. String manipulation 
will be used as a method to manipulate the database variables and dynamically arrange the data 
being displayed in the console
